## Introduction

In this article, we are going to be creating a JavaScript file.

Then we are going to try to import that `js` file as a script tag (in our React component).

## Does script tag exist in JSX?

Yes, by default you can add the closing tag `<script/>`, and then you can import the src javascript file.

The only downside is that **you won't be able to add code between the script tags**, as you would do with an HTML file. But you can call a script which will call that function.

## How to add a Script tag in JSX?

1. **First solution:**

If you want to only and exclusively import a script tag.

Then you can do the following:

```js
import scriptTag from './scriptTag'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <script src={scriptTag} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```js
// scriptTag.js

function scriptTag() {
  console.log('Script Tag has been imported correctly.')
}
scriptTag()
```

Think on this for a second, and then realize that with that method is all you need. No react helment, and no dependencies. Whether you are trying to add a live chat or Google Analytics into your React app, you can add all the necessary script code in the scriptTag function.

## dangerouslySetInnerHTML

Another way to easily add a script tag in JSX, that doesn't require you to import a package but is setting your application to a potential vulnerability is by using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

In this case we are going to be adding Google Analytics with this method:

```js
<script async src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-****`} />
      <script
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `
            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
            function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
            gtag('js', new Date());
            gtag('config', 'G-****', {
              page_path: window.location.pathname,
            });
          `,
        }}
      />
```
