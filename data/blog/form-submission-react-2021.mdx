So recently I've got a React challenge where I had to create a simple web app which was a newsletter sign-up form made with HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript.

[https://github.com/Alejogb1/email-signup-form/](https://github.com/Alejogb1/email-signup-form/blob/main/index.html)

I've gone from some mistakes, learned some things and now I want to share with you guys what I've learned and try to show you what I know about making post submissions in React. 

## How to do form submissions in React?

If you understand how to do form submissions in JavaScript, you will already know how to do it in Reactjs. 

If you don't know, then follow these three steps: 

**1) Create a function to POST your data 2) Inside that function create a fetch HTTP request with a POST method, headers accepting JSON, and on the body, the data you want to send 3) Final step, create a form with an onSubmit pointing to the function you've just created** 

```js
async function postData() {
    await fetch("https://www.reactshark.com/", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: document.querySelector("#newsletter-email").textContent
      })
    });
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Learn to Make a POST submission</h2>
      <form onsubmit="postData()">
        <label>Subscribe to the newsletter</label>
        <input id="newsletter-email"></input>
      </form>
		</>
)
```

## üîê Working with credentials?

This would be the case for most of you including myself. In case that your API asks you to include a credential on your request. That's how you would do it:

```js
async function postData (){
    await fetch('https://www.reactshark.com/', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'credentials' : 'sh_9f57832f-126b-44f3-888f-8a370b155a18',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({email : document.querySelector("#newsletter-email").textContent })
    });
     
  }
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid using `method` and `action` attributes on your HTML

(at the same time you already have a function doing the POST request)

In the case you are following this tutorial, then using attributes like `method="POST"` or `action="URL/endpoint"` will break your app. (Again, if you have already a function in charge of doing the POST request) 

Because when using a function, in this case, called `postData()` that's being executed on your `onSubmit`, it's not necessary to use other *attributes* on your HTML form. 

Otherwise, **you will be calling 2 times your POST method** and the second call will not have the things that `postData` has. **No *headers*, and no *body***, just the action, and the method.

Using attributes on your HTML might be useful when integrating a third-party service like getForm. You just have to include the endpoint and that's it, there is no need for a postData function.

## An alternative to form submissions in React: Postman

 Postman is a tool to test requests to your server. Instead of creating all the code shown in this article, **you would simply make the request with the Postman** application and that would be it.

Now, I've been having an issue when trying to create a POST request and for some reason, Postman is having trouble making the request. As a consequence, my server doesn't receive any when I press send.

You can check this resource to learn more about using Postman:
