## Fixing "**Can't resolve react router dom**"

It's `react-router-dom`, not react-dom

If you've made sure you have installed the correct dependency.

But still keep seeing that error then do:

`npm install react-router-dom --save`

or

`npm install -S react-router-dom`

**Why that works?**

The `—-save` option creates a dev dependency on your `package.json` file, which at the same time of solving this error for you, will allow you to automatically install that dependency in other computers and locations.

## Update NPM to version 5

"Before version 5, NPM simply installed a package under `node_modules` by default. When you were trying to install dependencies for your app/module, you would need to first install them, and then add them (along with the appropriate version number) to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json`." Read more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19578796/what-is-the-save-option-for-npm-install).

If you want to solve that kind of issues, like _Can't resolve to react router dom_ or even _Can't resolve axios_, then update NPM to the latest version by doing:

`npm update -g`

## Understanding the nature of this error

Can't resolve in most cases refers to an installation problem in your React app.

And it's the common case that you don't have the dependency you are trying to use.

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
```

One easy way to check if you have installed a dependency, in VS Code, is to press `ctrl + left click` on the `"react-router-dom"` words. If you get redirected to the origin, node_modules file of the dependency, then it's been installed, if not, correct that, install it again using the previous techniques.

## Using TypeScript?

When using Typescript for a React project, you need to run the following command:

`npm i @types/react-router-dom`
