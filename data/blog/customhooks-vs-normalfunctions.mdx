**A Custom Hook is a function you create for a component or a page in React, that '*function'* should start with *use, such as useFetch.***

You can check the [official blog of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html), where they have an explanation to Custom Hooks.

Essentially you are going to be using **useEffect inside your custom hook in order to fetch data**. In other words, you are going to be using a hook inside another one. 

Check this out:

In the following question, I'll play with [React's article about custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html), so I recommend checking it out before jumping there. 

## Why use Custom Hooks?

*Hide* complex logic. At least in [the React article](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html), the example they give us is to create a component, then create a custom hook to replace some logic inside it, so you are kind of **hiding the logic.**

Lets check the component with the already added custom hook in this case `useFriendStatus` :

```js
function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
}
```

As you will see down below, there is the same component but with no custom hook which was in this case `useFriendStatus()`

That logic that is highlighted, is the actual **logic that the custom hook has inside.**

## **What is the difference between a custom hook and a normal JS function?**

I mean, couldn't have you used a function like `changeFriendStatus()` instead of that custom Hook? Well, let's find out and try it by ourselves.

Here we have this app, where I've to create two buttons, one using the custom Hook `useToggle`, btw if you are looking for Custom Hooks examples you should genuinely check [this article](https://usehooks.com/).

**Custom hook**

```js
const useToggle = (initialState = false) => {
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

    const toggle = useCallback(() => setState((state) => !state), []);

    return [state, toggle];
  };

  const [isLightChanged, setLightChanged] = useToggle();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={setLightChanged}>Switch with custom hook</button>
      <p>{isLightChanged ? "On" : "Off"}</p>
    </div>
```

**Normal JS function?**

```js
function useToggle(initialState = false) {
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

    const toggle = useCallback(() => setState((state) => !state), []);

    return [state, toggle];
  }

  const [isLightChanged, setLightChanged] = useToggle();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={setLightChanged}>Switch with Function</button>
      <p>{isLightChanged ? "On" : "Off"}</p>
    </div>
  );
```

⚠️ Wait! This last piece of code is not a normal JavaScript function, it is a Custom Hook, such it is stateful and we are using other react hooks inside it. In normal JavaScript you can't manage states inside a function.

I would be asking the same thing but the importance relies on the essential difference between a hook and a function, such as one definition of a hook is that is a function. So in order to understand what separates them. We should take a look at the following point:

**Normal functions re-render while hooks don't**

This means that we **can't save our current state** in a normal function**.**

To understand what I'm saying, let's take the case where you implement useState, you know that **whenever the state changes your component re-renders.** So having this in mind, if somehow managed to create a function to handle your state, when the component re-renders then your function would lose all that information, cause **functions re-render, while hooks not**.

**Remember: Normal functions do not have states inside it**
**neither other custom hooks**
