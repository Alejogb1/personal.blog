After reading this article you should be ready to make a fetch from some API and display data _iteratively._

## Simple answer

```jsx
const Clients = () => {
  const data = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Peter',
      note: 'has a web design agency',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Andres',
      note: 'Beware he has too much money',
    },
  ]
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((client) => (
        <li>
          <h3>{client.name}</h3>
          <p>{client.note}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
export default Clients
```

## How to import JSON data from an API instead of a local object

Let's go with the Rick & Morty API.

```jsx
const Characters = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState([])
  const getData = async () => {
    // uso esta funcion en un useEffect
    const result = await fetch('https://rickandmortyapi.com/api')
    const data = await result.json()
    setData(data)
  }
}
```

You can go see my other article where I explain in detail how to create a map inside JSX and how to map each character (I use the same scenario).

```jsx
setData(data)
```

It is important to you either set your fetched data to an state **to then be able to map it through**. Or either you could do something more advanced like implementing a reducer or redux, which I don't recommend if you are just starting out.

## How to import JSON data from a backend server?

You gotta run two localhosts, one for the frontend and the other one for the backend. And the backend server should provide some API that returns a JSON. Basically, the answer to this question, is that **is the same as you would normally do with any API.**

Although the following example doesn't show the backend side, it should give you an idea on how you should import data from a backend server:

```jsx
const url = 'http://localhost:3000/api/data' // localhost:3000 is your backend

const [state, setState] = useState({ data: undefined })

const getData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const JSONdata = await response.json()
  setState({ data: JSONdata })
}
```
