## Intro

So one of the issues is that you have when using `new Date()` (JS function)

Is that it returns a long unformatted date

Something like: `Mon Aug 09 2021 20:38:05 GMT-0300 (standard time of Argentina)`

You want something much simpler like `Mon, 9 August 2021`

Here is a quick showcase of **the solution**:

```js
import { format } from 'date-fns'

// dd/mm/yyyy format
format(new Date(), 'dd/mm/yyyy')

// OR...
// dd/mm/yyyy format

format(new Date(), 'yyyy/mm/dd')
```

**Yes, it's that simple**.

But it's recommended to **continue reading** so you get to know how to apply `date-fns` to your projects.

## Formatting dd/mm/yyyy with `date-fns`

You can check the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/date-fns-03mgi?file=/src/App.js:311-321) of this section.

For this first step we are going to have a **list of blog posts**:

```js
// data.js

const data = [
  {
    title: 'How to cook',
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: 'The complete guide to digital marketing',
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
]
export default data
```

After we have the `data.js` file, we are going to **map through every blog post**:

```js
// App.js

import data from './data'
import { format } from 'date-fns'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((post) => (
          <li>
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>{format(post.createdAt, 'dd/mm/yyyy')}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you will see at the end of this article, **momentjs** which is a well-known library **has been** **deprecated**, which means we have now to use another library

The fact that we are not using Momentjs in this case, doesn't mean that we are now going with the worse option.

Actually, date-fns is much more optimized than momentjs and makes your app much more lightweight.

Basically, **date-fns is modular**, allowing you to only use the functions you'll use. Also, **its size is 44 kb**!

In conclusion, **date-fns performs much better** than momentjs.

## Formatting yyyy-mm-dd \**with *date-fns\*

Another thing people search for these days is ‚Äú_react date format yyyy-mm-dd_‚Äù, they want to know how to format a React date with the year at the most left, then the month, and at the end of the days.

```js
// App.js

import data from './data'
import { format } from 'date-fns'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Blog posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.map((post) => (
          <li>
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>{format(post.createdAt, 'yyyy/mm/dd')}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Formatting dates with no dependency

Here you have an option of just using native JavaScript functions to format your date in React.

```js
function formatDate(newDate) {
  const months = {
    0: 'January',
    1: 'February',
    2: 'March',
    3: 'April',
    4: 'May',
    5: 'June',
    6: 'July',
    7: 'August',
    8: 'September',
    9: 'October',
    10: 'November',
    11: 'December',
  }
  const days = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat']
  const d = newDate
  const year = d.getFullYear()
  const date = d.getDate()
  const monthIndex = d.getMonth()
  const monthName = months[d.getMonth()]
  const dayName = days[d.getDay()] // Thu

  const formatted = `${dayName}, ${date} ${monthName} ${year}`
  return formatted.toString()
}
return (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>Blog posts</h1>
    <ul>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <h3>{post.title}</h3>
          <p>{formatDate(post.createdAt)}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
)
```

You can check the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/formatting-data-react-newdate-5bl6o) [](https://codesandbox.io/s/date-fns-03mgi?file=/src/App.js:311-321)of this section.

## Shorter solution with no dependency

(Stack Overflow version)

```js
let today = new Date()

let date = today.getDate() + '-' + parseInt(today.getMonth() + 1) + '-' + today.getFullYear()

console.log(date)
```

Go to the console and see how it formats `new Date()`.

## Want to use international formats?

While this is less flexible, such as you are not formatting the date, you are just initializing your date based on the country standard.

Say you want to use US `(m/d/yyyy)` format

```js
const nowDate = new Date()

const UsFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US')

console.log(UsFormatter.format(nowDate))

// 8/9/2021
```

üí° Wait but you can actually **add some customization**

```js
const longEnUSFormatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
})
console.log(longEnUSFormatter.format(firstValentineOfTheDecade))
// February 14, 2020
```

## Exercise

Let's say you are creating an app with reusable components.

If you would have to create a Blog app, where you have data about each blog post.

```js
const blogPosts = [
  {
    title: 'How to cook',
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
  {
    title: 'The complete guide to digital marketing',
    createdAt: new Date(),
  },
]
```

‚ö†Ô∏è There is a problem with `new Date()`

It returns a l*ong unformatted Date,* and we want short dates with `dd/mm/yyyy` format

_How would you approach formatting dates?_

**Exercise: Create a React app and map the data above and format it**

## ‚ö†Ô∏èMomentjs is no longer mantained

While making this article I found that momentjs, a library like date-fns or any other to easily do cool stuff with dates, is no longer maintained and there will not be more features.

"We now generally consider Moment to be a legacy project in maintenance mode. It is not dead, but it is indeed done."
