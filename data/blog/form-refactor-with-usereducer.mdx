In this article, you are going to see a practical approach on how you can implement useReducer React hook,
and it also introduces the idea of reducer, so it's beginner-friendly!

So we have this form

```js
import { FormControl, FormLabel, FormHelperText, Input, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'
const Form = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('')

  return (
    <FormControl id="form" p={50}>
      <FormLabel>First and last name</FormLabel>
      <Input type="text" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <FormLabel>Email address</FormLabel>
      <Input type="email" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
      <FormHelperText>We'll never share your email.</FormHelperText>
      <FormLabel>Password</FormLabel>
      <Input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
      <Button mt={4} colorScheme="teal" type="submit">
        Login
      </Button>
    </FormControl>
  )
}
export default Form
```

We are using Chakra UI, a React library, and in case you don't know how to install it, go [here](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started).

So the first thing we want to do is to create our initialState.

This will be an object containing our 3 states: `name`, `email` and `password`.

```js
const initialState = {
  name : '',
  email : '',
  password : ''
}

const Form = () => {
...
}
```

Now import the `useReducer` hook

```js
import { useState, useReducer } from 'react'
```

So here comes the new part for you if you are just learning the concept of reducer.

We are going to create a separate file called `reducer.js` where it will have a function that handles our state.

```js
// reducer.js

function reducer(state, action) {}
```

As you can see we take two parameters:

1. `state` this will be the state we receive from the dispatch method that was executed in our case from `App.js`
2. `action` someone calls it the `actionObject` because when dispatched it looks like this:

```js
const action = {
    type: 'FETCH'
		data : "Alejo"
  };
```

Continuing with the reducer function, now lets build our `switch` cases

```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE':
      return {
        ...state,
        [action.key]: action.value,
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

So what's going on here?

**The switch statement**, which will be in charge of aligning the `action.type` to the changes the reducer is going to implement. In other words, the switch will determine those changes like modifying the state BASED on the value of theÂ `action.type`

Are you getting it now?

**The spread operator** is `...state` and what it does is basically copying the entire state, in order to only modify only the `[action.key] : action.value`

Having explained the above, now let's add the reducer function into the `App.js` component

```js
import reducer from "./reducer"
import { useState, useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
  password: ""
};

const Form = () => {
// const [name, setName] = useState("");
// const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
// const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

const [reducerState, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

...
}
```

Following that we are going to change value of our input from the `useState`, to the `initialState` and change the `onChange` setting state functions to the reducer ones using _dispatch_.

```js
<Input
  type="text"
  value={reducerState.name}
  onChange={(e) =>
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE',
      value: e.target.value,
      key: 'name',
    })
  }
/>
```

```js
<Input
  type="email"
  value={reducerState.email}
  onChange={(e) =>
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE',
      value: e.target.value,
      key: 'email',
    })
  }
/>
```

```js
<Input
  type="password"
  value={reducerState.password}
  onChange={(e) =>
    dispatch({
      type: 'UPDATE',
      value: e.target.value,
      key: 'password',
    })
  }
/>
```

### Final step

Let's create a `console.log` inside a `submit()` function, so we get to see the complete state from the reducer, and confirm that we have refactored the form successfully:

```js
const Form = () => {

  function submit() {
    console.log({
      name: reducerState.name,
      email: reducerState.email,
      password: reducerState.password
    });
  }
  return (
		  ...
      <Button onClick={() => submit()} mt={4} colorScheme="teal" type="submit">
        Login
      </Button>
  );
};
export default Form;
```

OUTPUT:

`{name: 'asadsasd', email: 'adsda@gmail.com', password: 'sadadada'}`

Success! Now you have a React form working with `useReducer`

## Complete refactored form code:

Couldn't post a Github repo, but cou can check its [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/form-react-usereducer-gwu19).

```js
// App.js
import { FormControl, FormLabel, FormHelperText, Input, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import reducer from './reducer'
import { useState, useReducer } from 'react'
const initialState = {
  name: '',
  email: '',
  password: '',
}

const Form = () => {
  const [reducerState, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  function submit() {
    console.log({
      name: reducerState.name,
      email: reducerState.email,
      password: reducerState.password,
    })
  }
  return (
    <FormControl id="form" p={50}>
      <FormLabel>First and last name</FormLabel>
      <Input
        type="text"
        value={reducerState.name}
        onChange={(e) =>
          dispatch({
            type: 'UPDATE',
            value: e.target.value,
            key: 'name',
          })
        }
      />
      <FormLabel>Email address</FormLabel>
      <Input
        type="email"
        value={reducerState.email}
        onChange={(e) =>
          dispatch({
            type: 'UPDATE',
            value: e.target.value,
            key: 'email',
          })
        }
      />
      <FormHelperText>We'll never share your email.</FormHelperText>
      <FormLabel>Password</FormLabel>
      <Input
        type="password"
        value={reducerState.password}
        onChange={(e) =>
          dispatch({
            type: 'UPDATE',
            value: e.target.value,
            key: 'password',
          })
        }
      />
      <Button onClick={() => submit()} mt={4} colorScheme="teal" type="submit">
        Login
      </Button>
    </FormControl>
  )
}
export default Form
```

```js
// reducer.js

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE':
      return {
        ...state,
        [action.key]: action.value,
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
export default reducer
```
