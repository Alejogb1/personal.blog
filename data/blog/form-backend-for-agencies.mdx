Hey there!

Would you like to hear about a product that is going to saves you time in your web design & development processes?

## Little story

Recently I've finished a big website for a Hotel in Mexico and had to build a simple contact page.

I tried to use getForm.io but as they didn't have a reCaptcha feature at that time, my client who was receiving the form email submissions started to receive p#rn spam promotions.

Not happy at all with this situation, decided to contact immediately customer support.

I didn't get any solution, so I changed from service.

This other service doesn't still satisfy my client's needs and mine neither.

## What is the product?

A form backend, or form endpoint as a service called formNest made for designers.

If you are not familiarized with these terms, which I doubt if you've already been into the pain of building a form from scratch on your client's website.

Basically, it is a service that frees you from creating your own backend to handle form submissions.

**The price: FREE**

## Why should you get the formNest?

Simply WORKS and has an exclusive customer support

Saves you 1-3 hours of your TIME by creating every form backend for you

And gains you MORE REVENUE by satisfying you and your clients

## How does it work?

So this is the tool, suppose you've got a contact form to create for a client

How would you approach creating it?

We've got you covered, by simply adding a unique endpoint to your action attribute in your form HTML

tag you are ready to go and anyone can now submit a form in the website you've built!

```jsx
<form action="{formnest-endpoint}" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

The magic relies here:

```jsx
<form action="{formnest-endpoint}" method="POST">
```

After implementing the form nest-endpoint there is no need to implement any backend code!

Customer support time
Well, I normally do computer science chores in the morning.

And during the afternoon SEO and freelance client work like the one I mentioned at the beginning of this article.
