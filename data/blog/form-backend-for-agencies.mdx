Hey there!

If you are reading this, is probably because I reach out to you via Email

Or simply because you come from some social media like my small but growing [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alejogb1) following :P

Would you like to hear about a product that is going to **save you time** in your web design & development process?

Recently I've finished a big website for a Hotel in Mexico and had to build a simple contact page.

I tried to use [getForm.io](http://getform.io) but as they didn't have a reCaptcha feature at that time, my client who was receiving the form email submissions started to receive p#rn spam promotions.

Not happy at all with this situation, decided to contact immediately customer support.

I didn't get any solution, so I changed from service.

This other service doesn't still satisfy my client's needs and mine neither.

## What is the product/offer?

A **form backend**, or **form endpoint** as a service.

If you are not familiarized with these terms, which I doubt if you've already been into the pain of building a form from scratch on your client's website.

Basically, it is a service that **frees you from creating your own backend** to handle form submissions.

The price: **$66/month (USD)**

## Why should you get the formNest subscription?

This is expensive, such as I'm the only one here.

I can't handle having that many customers, prefer to have 10 that are willing to pay,

In exchange, I leave my promise that I'll build something that:

1. **Simply WORKS** and has an **exclusive customer support**
2. **Saves you TIME** by creating every form backend for you
3. And **gains you** **MORE REVENUE** by satisfying you and your clients

## How does it work?

So this is the tool, suppose you've got a contact form to create for a client

How would you approach creating it?

We've got you covered, by simply adding a unique endpoint to your `action` attribute in your form HTML tag you are ready to go and anyone can now submit a form in the website you've built!

```js
<form action="{formnest-endpoint}" method="POST">

  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <button type="submit">Send</button>

</form>
```

The magic relies here:

```js
<form action="{formnest-endpoint}" method="POST">
```

After implementing the form nest-endpoint there is **no need to implement any backend code**!

## Customer support time

Well, I normally do computer science chores in the morning.

And during the afternoon SEO and freelance client work like the one I mentioned at the beginning of this article.

Schedule

**Mon to Friday**:

**6:30 pm - 8:30 pm** (Chicago time GMT-5)

A friendly reminder from the founder of this tool:

## You are supporting the future of your form's backend
